        "To solve this problem, we need to determine if two vectors given by their coordinates are collinear. Collinear vectors lie on the same straight line and can be scalar multiples of each other. The solution should handle edge cases such as vectors with zero coordinates without causing division errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Approach\n",
        "1. **Check for Zero Vectors** : If either of the vectors is a zero vector (both coordinates are zero), they are collinear with any other vector. This includes cases where one or both vectors are zero vectors.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Cross Product Check** : For non-zero vectors, we use the cross product method. Two vectors `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` are collinear if their cross product `(x1*y2 - x2*y1)` is zero. This avoids division operations and handles all edge cases effectively."

        "1. **Zero Vector Check** : The function first checks if either vector is a zero vector. If either vector is `(0,0)`, they are collinear by definition, so the function returns True immediately.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Cross Product Calculation** : If neither vector is a zero vector, the function calculates the cross product. If the cross product is zero, the vectors are collinear, and the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.\n",
